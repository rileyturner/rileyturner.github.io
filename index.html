      <h1 class="animate introductionTitle"><strong>A little about me...</strong></h1>
      <h2 class="animate introduction">
        From a young age, I've always been fascinated with computers. This hidden magic that allowed me to play my
        favourite games, watch digitalised content, and communicate with the greater digital community.
      </h2>
      <h2 class="animate introduction">
        The idea of automation has always interested me, from placing rocks on my keyboard to automate keyboard inputs,
        to creating legitimate applications capable of functioning regardless of what the user was doing, I wanted to
        learn more.
      </h2>
      <h2 class="animate introduction"><strong>In 2021</strong>, I had my first experience with Unity, in the form of a 2D side scrolling
        game. The application didn't
        turn out as I had hoped, largely as a result of my limited programming experience, however this only served to
        fuel my dream of software development as a career opportunity.</h2>
      <h2 class="animate introduction"><strong>In 2023</strong>, I started my bachelor's degree in computer science, majoring in
        Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. This degree was my first real introduction to the vastly
        intriguing field, introducing me to a plethora of exciting computer science topics, such as memory management,
        object-oriented programming and software engineering. Through these courses I developed a 2D RPG-style game
        within C++, and blackjack within MATLAB using ASCII art.</h2>
      <h2 class="animate introduction"><strong>In 2024</strong>, I began to refine my understanding of a computer's internal functions
        down to the chip level, as well as expand my knowledge in relation to the production and hosting of both static
        and dynamic web pages. This page serves to demonstrate said understanding.</h2>
      <h2 class="animate introduction">In my free time I enjoy playing FPS shooter games, watching Netflix, and solving
        coding problems. I am a very competitive person and strive to improve and refine my character in all aspects
        wherever possible.</h2>
