      <h1 class="animate title"><strong>A little about me...</strong></h1>
      <h2 class="animate introduction">
        I've always been fascinated with computers. This hidden magic that allowed me to play my favourite games, watch
        digitalised content, and communicate with the greater digital community. From a young age, the idea of
        <strong>automation</strong> has always captivated me, whether it was placing rocks on my keyboard to automate
        keyboard inputs or creating legitimate applications capable of functioning regardless of what the user was
        doing. I wanted to learn more.
      </h2>

      <h2 class="animate introduction">
        In <strong>2021</strong>, I had my first hands-on experience with programming, in the form of a 2D
        side-scrolling game made within <strong>Unity</strong>. Although the project didn't turn out as I had
        hoped, it
        served to fuel my
        dream of <strong>software development</strong> as a career pathway.
      </h2>

      <h2 class="animate introduction">
        In <strong>2023</strong>, I began my bachelor's degree in computer science, majoring in <strong>Artificial
          Intelligence and Machine Learning</strong>. This degree was my first real introduction to the vastly
        intriguing field, introducing me to a fascinating array of computer science concepts, such as <strong>memory
          management, object-oriented programming, and software engineering</strong>. Through these courses, I developed
        a 2D RPG-style game within C++, and blackjack within MATLAB using ASCII art.
      </h2>

      <h2 class="animate introduction">
        By <strong>2024</strong>, I had deepened my understanding of computer internals down to the chip level, as well
        as expanded my knowledge in relation to the production and hosting of both <strong>static and dynamic web
          pages</strong>. This
        page is a testament to said understanding.
      </h2>

      <h2 class="animate introduction">
        In my free time I enjoy playing FPS shooter games, watching Netflix, and
        tackling coding problems. I am a very competitive person and strive to improve and refine my
        character in all aspects wherever possible.
