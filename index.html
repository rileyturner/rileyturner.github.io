      <h2 class="animate introduction">
        Hey! my name's Riley! I'm a 20-year-old student studying computer science at the University of Adelaide,
        majoring in <strong>artificial intelligence</strong>.
      </h2>

      <h2 class="animate introduction">
        In <strong>2021</strong>, I had my first hands-on experience with programming, in the form of a 2D
        side-scrolling game made within <strong>Unity</strong>. While the project faced some challenges, it sparked a deep interest in 
        <strong>game devlopment</strong> and <strong>software engineering</strong> as a career pathway.
      </h2>

      <h2 class="animate introduction">
        In <strong>2023</strong>, I began my bachelor's degree in computer science, majoring in <strong>Artificial
          Intelligence and Machine Learning</strong>. This degree was my first real introduction to computer science
        concepts like <strong>cyber security,
          object-oriented programming,</strong> and <strong>software engineering</strong>. By the end of the year, I had developed a 2D
        RPG-style
        game within C++, and blackjack within MATLAB.
      </h2>

      <h2 class="animate introduction">
        By <strong>2024</strong>, I had deepened my understanding of computer internals down to the chip level, as well
        as expanded my knowledge in relation to the production and hosting of both <strong>static</strong> and <strong> dynamic web
          pages</strong>. This
        page is a testament to said understanding.
      </h2>

      <h2 class="animate introduction">
        In <strong>2025</strong>, I began to take courses that were far more specific to my major, specifically that of
        <strong>artificial intelligence,
          computer vision,</strong> and <strong>cyber security</strong>. With some free time on my hands, I began to work on some small
        passion projects such as a <strong>Discord bot</strong> and <strong>an automated Twitch engagement bot</strong>. Both projects are covered within the Projects section.
      </h2>

      <h2 class="animate introduction">
        In my free time I enjoy playing hero shooters, watching Netflix, and tackling coding problems. I am highly
        competitive by nature, and I believe this drive pushes
        me to continually improve - not just in my skills, but in my character <strong>wherever possible.</strong>
